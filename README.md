# Enochian Language Modeling
Hacking the Enochian language and Liber Loagaethâ€”because why not look at glossolalia with a fresh set of AIs? ðŸ¥¸

## notes

`dictionary.json` is, at present, not finalâ€”I am still refining the dictionary. A lot of this is under developmentâ€”very early stages.

You also will want to run `poetry run python -m src/enochian_translation_team/tools/train_fasttext_model.py` to get the models going before running `main.py`. The models are absolutely necessary for this to work.

## Applied computational linguistics (for... pre-phase one)

Throw FastText at it. See the above mentioned `train_fasttext_model.py` for some sense as to what I'm going for, comparing it to the `dictionary.json`.

## Agentic team plan (for phase one)

1. Orchestrator Agent
    - Role: Overseer and final arbiter
    - Input: word + linguist + skeptic reports
    - Output: accepts/rejects root proposal and adds them to the roots.json via tool
2. Linguist Agent
    - Role: Root extractor
    - Tools: FastText, heuristics of various kinds, maybe LLM help
    - Output: proposed root word, reasoning, likelihood score
3. Skeptic Agent
    - Role: "Prove it" gremlin
    - Tools: access to same data, challenges proposed roots with counterexamples, alternate etymologies, etc.
    - Output: objections, counterpoints, uncertainty measures
